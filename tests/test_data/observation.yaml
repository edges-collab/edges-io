# This file is an example file for _externally_ "defining" an observation. \
# It should not be included inside an observation directory, but rather it sets out
# various files that should be included to form a full virtual observation.

# This is supposed to be exact and exhaustive, and it will likely contain a lot of
# repetition. However, you can use use the "write_observation_yaml" method in the
# CalibrationObservation to do most of the work for you.

# A root observation directory from which all paths in this definition are relative
# (unless specified as absolute).
